Downloads audio from Swedish public service radio program 'Mammas nya kille'

There is a radio program that is called 'Mammas nya kill' which I wanted to have likely to listen to. It's free to download but quite cumbersome to manually go through and click on every download link I wanted.. So I made this little script using BeautifulSoup!

You get to choose which character you want to download from. But this script was made a while back and I'm sure it needs some tweaks to get working again :)
